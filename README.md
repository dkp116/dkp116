## Hii

### Academic Background

Iâ€™m currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Mathematical Finance. My dissertation involves comparing the Finite Difference Model and Monte Carlo Simulation for pricing options. This work aims to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of financial modeling techniques.

### Professional Experience

I work as a Software Engineer at an insurance firm, where Iâ€™m developing a sophisticated application to streamline the processing of contract slips. This application, which handles both digital and scanned documents, creates a database to automate data retrieval. Iâ€™m leveraging Azure OpenAI and Azure ComputerVision APIs to significantly reduce manual processing time and improve team efficiency.

### Current Projects

Iâ€™m currently diving into the realm of machine learning, guided by Christopher M. Bishopâ€™s book, *Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning*. This study is enhancing my skills and knowledge in the field, particularly in relation to stochastic processes and data analysis.

### Collaboration & Interests

Iâ€™m passionate about machine learning and stochastic calculus and am eager to contribute to projects or research in these areas. If youâ€™re working on something exciting or looking for collaboration opportunities, feel free to connect with me!
